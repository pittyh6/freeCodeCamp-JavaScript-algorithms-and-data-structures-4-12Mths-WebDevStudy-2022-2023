    * Declare JavaScript Variables
        * JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.
        * Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.
        * Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
    * Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
        *  var variableName = value;
    * Declare String Variables
        * var myName = "your name";
    * Understanding Uninitialized Variables
        * When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
            * If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
            * If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.
