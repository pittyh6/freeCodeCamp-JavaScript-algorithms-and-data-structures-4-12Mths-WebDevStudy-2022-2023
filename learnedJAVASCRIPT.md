# Web Developer Study
## 12 months web developer study. I decided to dedicate at least 12 months to learn web development.

* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

    * Declare JavaScript Variables
        * JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.
        * Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.
        * Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
    * Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
        *  var variableName = value;
    * Declare String Variables
        * var myName = "your name";
    * Understanding Uninitialized Variables
        * When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
            * If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
            * If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.
    * Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
        * In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.
        * Best Practice
            * Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
    
    * Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords
        * One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations.
        * A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword.
    * Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
        * In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.
        * const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

    * add One Number to Another with JavaScript
        * var n = 5 + 10;
    * Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
        * const myVar = 12 - 6;
    * Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
        * const myVar = 13 * 13;
    * Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
        * const myVar = 16 / 2;

    * Increment a Number with JavaScript
        * i++;
        * i = i + 1;
        * ++i;
    * Decrement a Number with JavaScript
        * i--;
        * i = i - 1;

    * Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
        *  Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.
        *  myDecimal = 7.5;
    * Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
        * const product = 2.0 * 2.5;
    * Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
        * const quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; 
    * Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
        * The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
        * 5 % 2 = 1 because
            Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
            2 * 2 = 4
            5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
        * const remainder = 11%3;
    * Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
        * In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:
            * myVar = myVar + 5;
        * One such operator is the += operator.
            * myVar += 5;
    * Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
