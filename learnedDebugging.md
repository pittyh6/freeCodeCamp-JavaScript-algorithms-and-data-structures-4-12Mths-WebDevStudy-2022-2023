# Web Developer Study
## 12 months web developer study. I decided to dedicate at least 12 months to learn web development.

* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### Debugging
# Console.log()
* Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable
        * Both Chrome and Firefox have excellent JavaScript consoles, also known as DevTools, for debugging your JavaScript.
        * You can find Developer tools in your Chrome's menu or Web Console in Firefox's menu. If you're using a different browser, or a mobile phone, we strongly recommend switching to desktop Firefox or Chrome.
            * The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic points in your code can show you the intermediate values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before looking at what it is. Having check points to see the status of your calculations throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is.
            * Here's an example to print the string Hello world! to the console:
                * console.log('Hello world!');
# typeof()   
* Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
    * You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.
        * Here are some examples using typeof:
            * console.log(typeof "");
            console.log(typeof 0);
            console.log(typeof []);
            console.log(typeof {});
            In order, the console will display the strings string, number, object, and object.
        * JavaScript recognizes seven primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol (new with ES6), and BigInt (new with ES2020), and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.
