# Web Developer Study
## 12 months web developer study. I decided to dedicate at least 12 months to learn web development.

* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### JavaScript ES6 / ES2015
* ES6
    * Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords
        * When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.
        * The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.
        * Variable declarations as global (var i = 0;). This behavior will cause problems if you were to create a function and store it for later use inside a for loop that uses the i variable. This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of the updated global i variable.
    * Mutate an Array Declared with const
        * The const declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.
        * Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use let.
        * However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.
    * Prevent Object Mutation
