## What I learned/used 
# Learn About Functional Programming
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:

Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

# Understand Functional Programming Terminology
Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called higher order functions.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13);
// Only change code above this line

console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);

# Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code
In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.

A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.

The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for tabOpen(), tabClose(), and join(). The array tabs is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.
// tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
const Window = function(tabs) {
  this.tabs = tabs; // We keep a record of the array inside the object
};

// When you join two windows into one window
Window.prototype.join = function(otherWindow) {
  this.tabs = this.tabs.concat(otherWindow.tabs);
  return this;
};

// When you open a new tab at the end
Window.prototype.tabOpen = function(tab) {
  this.tabs.push('new tab'); // Let's open a new tab for now
  return this;
};

// When you close a tab
Window.prototype.tabClose = function(index) {

  // Only change code below this line

  const tabsBeforeIndex = this.tabs.splice(0, index); // Get the tabs before the tab
  const tabsAfterIndex = this.tabs.splice(1); // Get the tabs after the tab

  this.tabs = tabsBeforeIndex.concat(tabsAfterIndex); // Join them together

  // Only change code above this line

  return this;
 };

// Let's create three browser windows
const workWindow = new Window(['GMail', 'Inbox', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp']); // Your mailbox, drive, and other work sites
const socialWindow = new Window(['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium']); // Social sites
const videoWindow = new Window(['Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vimeo', 'Vine']); // Entertainment sites

// Now perform the tab opening, closing, and other operations
const finalTabs = socialWindow
  .tabOpen() // Open a new tab for cat memes
  .join(videoWindow.tabClose(2)) // Close third tab in video window, and join
  .join(workWindow.tabClose(1).tabOpen());
console.log(finalTabs.tabs);

# Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming
If you haven't already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the splice call in the tabClose() function. Unfortunately, splice changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.

This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.

One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.

The previous example didn't have any complicated operations but the splice method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.

Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

Let's try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.
// the global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer() {
  // Add your code below this line
  return fixedValue + 1;

  // Add your code above this line
}

var newValue = incrementer(); // Should equal 5
console.log(fixedValue); // Should print 4

# Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function
The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.

We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.

Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.

This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.

Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

var fixedValue = 4;

// Add your code below this line
function incrementer(value) {
  return value + 1;

  // Add your code above this line
}

var differentValue = incrementer(fixedValue); // Should equal 5

console.log(fixedValue); // Should print 4

# Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions
So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:

Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. Hint: using something like const newArr = arrVar, where arrVar is an array will simply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. So changing a value in newArr would change the value in arrVar.

Declare function parameters - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.

Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.
// the global variable
var bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

/* This function should add a book to the list and return the list */
// New parameters should come before bookName

// Add your code below this line
function add(arr, bookName) {
  let newArr = [...arr]; // Copy the bookList array to a new array.
  newArr.push(bookName); // Add bookName parameter to the end of the new array.
  return newArr; // Return the new array.
}

/* This function should remove a book from the list and return the list */
// New parameters should come before the bookName one

// Add your code below this line
function remove(arr, bookName) {
  let newArr = [...arr]; // Copy the bookList array to a new array.
  if (newArr.indexOf(bookName) >= 0) {
    // Check whether the bookName parameter is in new array.
    newArr.splice(newArr.indexOf(bookName), 1); // Remove the given paramater from the new array.
    return newArr; // Return the new array.
  }
}

var newBookList = add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time');
var newerBookList = remove(bookList, 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');
var newestBookList = remove(add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time'), 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');

console.log(bookList);


# Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array
The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.

See below for an example using the map method on the users array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const names = users.map(user => user.name);
console.log(names);
The console would display the value [ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ].

const ratings = watchList.map(item => ({
  title: item["Title"],
  rating: item["imdbRating"]
}));


# Implement map on a Prototype
As you have seen from applying Array.prototype.map(), or simply map() earlier, the map method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.

In other words, map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.

You might learn a lot about the map method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().
// the global Array
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback) {
  var newArray = [];
  // Add your code below this line
  this.forEach(a => newArray.push(callback(a)));
  // Add your code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myMap(function(item) {
  return item * 2;
});


# Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array
Another useful array function is Array.prototype.filter(), or simply filter().

filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns true. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.

The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.

See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);
console.log(usersUnder30); 
The console would display the value [ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ].

const filteredList = watchList
  .filter(movie => movie.imdbRating >= 8.0)
  .map(movie => ({ title: movie["Title"], rating: movie["imdbRating"] }));
// Only change code above this line
console.log(filteredList);



# Return Part of an Array Using the slice Method
The slice method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.

Here's an example:

const arr = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra"];
const newArray = arr.slice(1, 3);
newArray would have the value ["Dog", "Tiger"].


# Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice
A common pattern while working with arrays is when you want to remove items and keep the rest of the array. JavaScript offers the splice method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to start removing items, then the number of items to remove. If the second argument is not provided, the default is to remove items through the end. However, the splice method mutates the original array it is called on. Here's an example:

const cities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
cities.splice(3, 1);
Here splice returns the string London and deletes it from the cities array. cities will have the value ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "Berlin"].

As we saw in the last challenge, the slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one which can be saved into a variable. Recall that the slice method takes two arguments for the indices to begin and end the slice (the end is non-inclusive), and returns those items in a new array. Using the slice method instead of splice helps to avoid any array-mutating side effects.


# Combine Two Arrays Using the concat Method
Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. Here's an example:

[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);
The returned array would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

# Add Elements to the End of an Array Using concat Instead of push
unctional programming is all about creating and using non-mutating functions.

The last challenge introduced the concat method as a way to merge arrays into a new array without mutating the original arrays. Compare concat to the push method. push adds items to the end of the same array it is called on, which mutates that array. Here's an example:

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4, 5, 6);
arr would have a modified value of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is not the functional programming way.

concat offers a way to merge new items to the end of an array without any mutating side effects.


# Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data
Array.prototype.reduce(), or simply reduce(), is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problem using the reduce method.

The reduce method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both filter and map can be derived as special applications of reduce. The reduce method iterates over each item in an array and returns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array). This is achieved via a callback function that is called on each iteration.

The callback function accepts four arguments. The first argument is known as the accumulator, which gets assigned the return value of the callback function from the previous iteration, the second is the current element being processed, the third is the index of that element and the fourth is the array upon which reduce is called.

In addition to the callback function, reduce has an additional parameter which takes an initial value for the accumulator. If this second parameter is not used, then the first iteration is skipped and the second iteration gets passed the first element of the array as the accumulator.

See below for an example using reduce on the users array to return the sum of all the users' ages. For simplicity, the example only uses the first and second arguments.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const sumOfAges = users.reduce((sum, user) => sum + user.age, 0);
console.log(sumOfAges);
The console would display the value 64.

In another example, see how an object can be returned containing the names of the users as properties with their ages as values.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersObj = users.reduce((obj, user) => {
  obj[user.name] = user.age;
  return obj;
}, {});
console.log(usersObj);
The console would display the value { John: 34, Amy: 20, camperCat: 10 }.

function getRating(watchList){
  // Add your code below this line
  const averageRating = watchList
    // Use filter to find films directed by Christopher Nolan
    .filter(film => film.Director === "Christopher Nolan")
    // Use map to convert their ratings from strings to numbers
    .map(film => Number(film.imdbRating))
    // Use reduce to add together their ratings
    .reduce((sumOfRatings, rating) => sumOfRatings + rating) /
  // Divide by the number of Nolan films to get the average rating
  watchList.filter(film => film.Director === "Christopher Nolan").length;
  // Add your code above this line
  return averageRating;
}

console.log(getRating(watchList));



# Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method
The sort method sorts the elements of an array according to the callback function.

For example:

function ascendingOrder(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}

ascendingOrder([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]);
This would return the value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

function reverseAlpha(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a === b ? 0 : a < b ? 1 : -1;
  });
}

reverseAlpha(['l', 'h', 'z', 'b', 's']);
This would return the value ['z', 's', 'l', 'h', 'b'].

# Return a Sorted Array Without Changing the Original Array
A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place. One way to avoid this is to first concatenate an empty array to the one being sorted (remember that slice and concat return a new array), then run the sort method.


# Split a String into an Array Using the split Method
The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.

Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:

const str = "Hello World";
const bySpace = str.split(" ");

const otherString = "How9are7you2today";
const byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);
bySpace would have the value ["Hello", "World"] and byDigits would have the value ["How", "are", "you", "today"].

Since strings are immutable, the split method makes it easier to work with them.
function splitify(str) {
  // Add your code below this line
  return str.split(/\W/);
  // Add your code above this line
}
splitify("Hello World,I-am code");

# Combine an Array into a String Using the join Method
The join method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.

Here's an example:

const arr = ["Hello", "World"];
const str = arr.join(" ");
str would have a value of the string Hello World.
function sentensify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line
const newArr = str.split(/\W/)
console.log(newArr)
const newStr = newArr.join(" ")
console.log(newStr)
return newStr

  // Only change code above this line
}

sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you");


# Use the every Method to Check that Every Element in an Array Meets a Criteria
The every method works with arrays to check if every element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if all values meet the criteria, false if not.

For example, the following code would check if every element in the numbers array is less than 10:

const numbers = [1, 5, 8, 0, 10, 11];

numbers.every(function(currentValue) {
  return currentValue < 10;
});
The every method would return false here.


function checkPositive(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  
  console.log(arr.every(elem => elem > 0))
return arr.every(elem => elem > 0)

  // Only change code above this line
}

checkPositive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]);


# Use the some Method to Check that Any Elements in an Array Meet a Criteria
The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if any of the values meet the criteria, false if not.

For example, the following code would check if any element in the numbers array is less than 10:

const numbers = [10, 50, 8, 220, 110, 11];

numbers.some(function(currentValue) {
  return currentValue < 10;
});
The some method would return true.


function checkPositive(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

return arr.some(elem => elem > 0)

  // Only change code above this line
}

checkPositive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]);


# Introduction to Currying and Partial Application
The arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires. Currying a function means to convert a function of N arity into N functions of arity 1.

In other words, it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.

Here's an example:

function unCurried(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function curried(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

const curried = x => y => x + y

curried(1)(2)
curried(1)(2) would return 3.

This is useful in your program if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, which will hold the returned function reference that takes the next argument when it's available. Here's an example using the curried function in the example above:

const funcForY = curried(1);
console.log(funcForY(2)); // 3
Similarly, partial application can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and returning another function that is applied to more arguments. Here's an example:

function impartial(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

const partialFn = impartial.bind(this, 1, 2);
partialFn(10); // 13




function add(x) {
  // Only change code below this line
return function(y){
  return function(z){
    return x + y + z
  }
}

  // Only change code above this line
}

add(10)(20)(30);
